1.0 git global config
    > git config --global user.name "Andy"
    > git config --global user.email "andy@example.com"

1.1 when working in a directory, if we want to put the directory into git version control, we can use:
    > git init
    this command will create a hidder ./git directory in the current directory

1.2 Checking the Status
    > git status

1.3 to let git track a file call octocat.txt in the current directory
    > git add octocat.txt
    * staged: Files are ready to be committed
    * unstaged: Files with changes that have not been prepared to be committed
    * untracked: Files are not tracked by Git yet. This usually indicates a newly created file.
    * deleted: File has been deleted and is waiting to be removed from Git

1.4 to track all the files in current directory
    > git add -A .
    * -A ensures even file deletions are included

1.5 to unstaging or remove octocat.txt file from the staging area
    > git reset octocat.txt
    * Staging area: A place where we can group files togeter before commit them to git
    * A commit is a snapshot of our repository. This way if we ever need to look back at the changes we have made (or if someone else does), we will see a nice timeline of all changes

1.6 to move octocat.txt file from staging area to repository
    > git commit -m "Add this file to the repository"

1.7 use wildcard * to add all the files
    > git add '*.txt'

1.8 use git log to see the change hisotry, use --summary option to see more information for each commit.
    > git log

1.9 add a remote repository
   > git remote add origin https://github.com/acsujea/Hello.git

1.10 sync with remote
   > git pull origin master

1.11 push the local change in master to remote origin
   > git push -u origin master
   * origin: the repmote name
   * master: the local branch name
   * -u remember above parameters

1.12 see what is different from the last commit
   > git diff HEAD
   * HEAD is a pointer that points to the most recent commit

1.13 see that is different in the stage
   > git diff --staged
   * staged: files that are ready to commit
1.14 remove a file from the stage
   > git reset <fileName>
1.15 undo a file change back to its last commit
   > git checkout -- <filename>
1.16 branching out
   > git branch <branchname>
1.17 list all branches
   > git branch -a
1.18 switching to a branch
   > git checkout <branchname>
1.19 merge branch with anther branch
   > git merge <anotherbranch>
   * this is to take the change in <anothebranch> and merge into this branch
1.20 create a new branch and switch to it at the same time
   > git checkout -b new_branch

1.21 remove all files from the disk and stage the removal
   > git rm '*.*'
   * manually delete a file doesn't remove it from the staging, so git rm always need to be used
   * git commit to finally commit the delete
   * git commit -a auto removes deleted files
1.22 remove recursively folders and its files
   > git rm -r the_folder
